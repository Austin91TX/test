Board History

When the first coders learned how to code they started from the ground up. They werent taking classes to learn how to code, they were teaching themselves how to code. Now that the world has a million types of computers in varying shapes and sizes, there arent that many people teaching themselves how to code from scratch. The raspberry pi was created to reignite a want to learn how to code by starting at a very basic and simple level.

The Raspberry Pi was created for the purpose of Education. It was first used to teach basic computer science in schools and developing countries around the world.

Due to it's low price and high accessibility, the pi was scooped up by a large number of tinkerers and hobbyists

Here are some examples of what these tinkerers and hobbyists have done with the raspberry pi:

Terren Peterson from FreeCodeCamp.org
        used the first raspberry pi to light a red LED when it detected intruders near his daughter's minecraft castle. Then the second one he used to record humidity, temperature and soil moisture for his indoor garden.

On Oct 29th 2018, the Astro Pi Mission Zero launched. 
        Students and young people will have until 20 March 2019 to from teams and write a simple program to display their personal message to the astronauts onboard. The Mission Zero activity can be completed in a couple of hours with just a computer and an internet connection. You don’t need any special equipment or prior coding skills, and all participants that follow the guidelines are guaranteed to have their programs run in space.

10) Raspberry Pi Connect 4 Robot
        Do you remember the Connect 4 game? I loved that when I was kid! Well, now you can play against a Rasberry Pi! This comes from Pi and Chips.co.uk. He used the Pi, along with a MeArm kit and some other pieces and servos to create a very worthwhile opponent! He may be a little slower than you and I, but you can’t rush brilliance!

9) Bicycle Computer
        David Schneider from IEEE took a regular ol’ kindle….attached a Pi with WiFi and GPS, and turned it into a touchscreen bike computer for monitoring your speed, distance and navigation. I love this because all the bike displays on the market are so small. Just don’t crash your bike or the Kindle goes with…

8)  Artificial Pancreas
        How about helping a medical problem? Dana and Scott created the DIY Pancreas. Dana has diabetes and using this “closed loop” pancreas, using a Rasberry Pi, it’s able to not only keep an eye on her insulin levels, but also issues commands to her insulin pump while she’s asleep to keep her levels steady… without her waking up.

7) Mouse Trap
        How about a mouse trap that doesn’t hurt or kill them and you can release back into the wild? This thing is a box. Once the mouse goes in, it releases a door that traps them inside, then… get this… it takes a picture and texts you that you have a mouse and shows you the picture!

6) Magic Mirror
        How about this mirror that tells you “you look especially amazing today”. This is the Magic Mirror. You know how you’ve seen mirrors that show you the weather and news feeds? Well, those are freakin’ expensive! This is a hack that lets you do it yourself!

5) 3D Scanner
        This is really cool! A full 3D scanner using 40 Rasberry Pies and 40 Pi cameras. They also had 40 SD cards, a couple power supplies, and LED strips. It’ll scan a person or thing and they used Shapeways to print it in full color.

4) Barrel Arcade Machine
        Matt Shaw turned a wine barrel into a Rasberry Pi powered arcade machine. Yes. Yes he did. It’s using PiPlay, which is an OS for gaming and emulation. He mounted the monitor in the barrel with some glass over it. The controls are attached to the side. It’s pure awesome.

3) Doctor Who K-9
        If you’re a Doctor Who fan, sit down. I mean… seriously… sit down. On the floor. Cause you’re gonna want to pet and hang out with the K9 from Richard Hopkins. Its ears and tail move – driven by servos. He used Node-RED to control the monitor aka the eyes. and there’s a monitor on the side for communication. The Rasberry Pi and camera are behind his eyes. I want. 

2) Baby Monitor
        Parents, you’ll love this one. Baby Monitor detects crying while your baby is in the other room supposed to be sleeping. The Pi needs the Prota OS with Speech and a couple apps and voila – a baby monitor! It’ll also put your baby back to sleep if you want by playing music when it starts to cry. So you may not need to go in the room every few minutes. Just let the computer take over. It’s okay…

1)  Wall Mounted Calendar
        And… of course this one really gets me! You know how much I love my calendars, right? Like…over the top obsessed with my 23 Google Calendars… but that’s another story altogether! This is a Rasberry Pi with WiFi, and LCD screen and some other stuff that’ll display your calendar, the weather, and whatever else you want within reason. I love this one!
